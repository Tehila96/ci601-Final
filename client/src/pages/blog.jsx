                        <h3>How to make your clothes last longer</h3>

                        <p>As a society, we are less and less inclined to settle for one permanent wardrobe and take good care of it. 
                            Fast fashion has made buying clothes much more accessible, so there is no incentive to keep the clothes we already have.
                            In addition, we deal with a high turnover of trends. If in the past there were collections spread over two or three 
                            seasons a year, today they are replaced at a dizzying pace, and our desire as consumers to renew and feel fashionable 
                            is increasing. In the UK, for example, the average lifespan of an item of clothing is 2.2 years.</p>
                        <p>It is no secret that the fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world.
                            The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of annual global carbon emissions, more than all international
                            flights and maritime shipping combined. The fashion industry is also the second-largest consumer of the worldâ€™s
                            water supply. It takes around 2,000 gallons of water to make a typical pair of jeans. The fashion industry is also
                            responsible for 20% of all industrial water pollution worldwide. The fashion industry is also responsible for 20%
                            of all industrial water pollution worldwide.Extending the lifespan of our clothes is not only good for our pockets 
                            but also very beneficial for the environment.</p>
                        <p>It may seem far away, but not long ago, people learned basic sewing skills, and would make and maintain the thing 
                        over time. There is no doubt that if we want our clothes to last as long as possible and maintain their quality, 
                        buying them correctly and taking care of them is the best place to start.</p>
                        <p><h4>Do not be tempted by trends</h4>
                        There are several things that can be done during the buying phase, mainly thinking ahead and not being tempted by trends, 
                        deciding to bring a new garment into the home only if it is clear to us that it will be able to serve us for a long time</p>
                        <p><h4>Buy quality clothes</h4>
                        Some of the clothes consist of natural fibers such as cotton and linen and some consist of a mixture of synthetic and 
                        natural fabrics. When we choose a fabric it is important to consider several parameters such as the climate we will wear 
                        the garment and touch on the body, whether the garment creates a pleasant or itchy feeling.
                        Preference for a certain type is a personal matter. Some prefer to wear synthetic fabrics because they believe that the 
                        fibres from which they are made are more durable and wear less. Those who recommend wearing fabrics made of natural fibres 
                        claim that it probably breathes more. Also, washing synthetic fabrics, such as polyester, results in the addition of micro-
                        fibres, tiny micro-plastic particles, which are washed through the sewage systems into the sea and add to the type of plastic in the oceans.</p>
                        <p><h4>Wear it Right!</h4>
                        The washing step in the machine should be postponed as much as possible. Most of us wash far too much even clothes that haven't
                        really gotten dirty. Sometimes it is enough to ventilate, and if it is possible to also dilute the use of fabric softener - this is appropriate.
                        The fabric softener makes it pleasant but does not extend the life of the garment, on the contrary. Of course, it is time to bless the local 
                        weather and wash the clothes that we washed in the air, and in the shade and not in the dryer.
                        We need to be more responsible and adhere to the manufacturer's instructions regarding how to wash. As with high-quality clothes, 
                        the instructions correspond to the garment and are found on the label attached to it. The garment is washed quite hard at high 
                        temperatures, with soap and wringing, which damage the fibres that make it up. They really need to be washed and not only after 
                        being worn Once. I recommend choosing the appropriate conditions for the type of garment. For example, towels, linens and delicate 
                        laundry should be washed above 40 degrees, for cotton clothes 30 degrees will also be sufficient. In addition, delicate fabrics 
                        can be washed in a mesh bag to reduce their wear. It's also worth washing according to shades and prevents unnecessary dyeing of
                         clothes.</p>
                         <p><h4>Change our shopping strategy</h4>
                        The information that flows to us from all sides in recent years leaves us no choice, we must and must change our approach in the 
                        context of consumption in general and clothing consumption in particular. The price of buying 'disposable' clothes and cooperating 
                        with the world of fast fashion is simply too high, for us personally, for those who make the clothes, for the planet and for the
                         future of our children. The easiest thing we can do to be part of the change is to change our shopping strategy. Decide to consume
                          less and with more awareness, and best of all: focus on what we already have. In this sense, it is important to keep the clothes
                           we have in the closet. Even if they were bought really cheap.
                        It is very useful for us to save as much as possible on clothes and avoid another hasty purchase. It is always better to buy quality
                         second-hand, and you can even check what friends have and what is not useful for them, thus giving the garment another life before throwing it away.</p>
